{"name":"Eulexia","body":"SIL-OFL licensed typeface to assist in helping with some symptoms of dyslexia.\r\n\r\nYour brain can sometimes do funny things to letters. Eulexia tries to help prevent some of these things from happening. Letters have heavy weighted bottoms to add a kind of \"gravity\" to each letter, helping to keep your brain from rotating them around in ways that can make them look like other letters. Consistently weighted bottoms can also help reenforce the line of text. The unique shapes of each letter can help prevent flipping and swapping.\r\n\r\nFor more information and other typefaces, etc, see http://abbiecod.es or http://dyslexicfonts.com\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","tagline":"SIL-OFL licensed typeface to assist in helping with some symptoms of dyslexia.","google":"UA-35043315-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
